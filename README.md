# Bike Sharing Usage
This project is a part of the AAI-500 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD). 
<br><br>**Project Status: ACTIVE**

## Introduction
For this project, we analyze bike sharing usage count against season, temperature, and humidity to explain the likely causes of high bike sharing usage in 2011-2012 using multiple linear regression with analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing. Our goal is to inform stakeholders who are interesting in expanding bike sharing to untapped markets.
